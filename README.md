!!! Needs the camera to be available - recommend to use the real device for testing
!!! Currently can be tested on watches:
- [Rolex Air King and Rolex](https://monochrome-watches.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rolex-Oyster-Perpetual-Air-King-126900-2022-Review-10.jpg)

- ...the watch DB and expanded ML model are in progress...

# Instruction:
- In order to get dependencies inside the app and all local packages run `make get` in terminal 
- You can also use other `make` commands (like `make build-runner`, etc) described inside `wget/makefile'
